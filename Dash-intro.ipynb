    "Dash is the original low-code framework for rapidly building data apps in Python, R, Julia, and F# (experimental).\n",
    "\n",
    "Written on top of Plotly.js and React.js, Dash is ideal for building and deploying data apps with customized user interfaces. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build a full-stack web app with interactive data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface to your code in less than 10 minutes."
